## üìö How It Works

AxLens combines the power of modern data architecture and LLMs to deliver a seamless experience:

1. üìÑ **PDF Upload**  
   Crawled articles in PDF format uploads to a Snowflake internal stage

2. üß† **Text Chunking & Embedding**  
   Uses text splitting and vectorization (e.g., OpenAI embeddings, HuggingFace) to process text for similarity search

3. üîç **AI-Powered Query Engine**  
   When users ask questions, AxLens performs a similarity search against the vector store, returning relevant document chunks and summarizing them via an LLM.

4. üí¨ **Streamlit Chat UI**  
   Users interact using an intuitive chat interface powered by Streamlit.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/axlens.git
   cd axlens
   
2. Create a virtual environment & install dependencies
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3. Set environment variables:
   Create a .env file and configure your keys

	```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT=your_account
   SNOWFLAKE_USER=your_user
   SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD=your_password
   SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE=your_warehouse
   SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE=your_database
   SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA=your_schema
   
4. Execute the ipynb once on your snowflake

5. Run the streamlit app
	```bash
	streamlit run app.py
